# sleepStages

Initial idea to propose the task:

  1.Merge the data
  
  2.Sort the data by dateTime
  
  3.Check how many shortData are inside a Data stage
  
  4.Once I set a splited stage append it to a new list
  
  5.Retrieve the new list created
  

-------------------------


Final task:

The python file named "prueba.py" contains 2 funcitions.
The first one named "restructureData" to do the main task of problem and the second one named "sleepingStages" include whole problem including "restructureData".

At the begging of the code it include 2 test to run the program in a very easy way.
Just need to uncomment the test data that you want to try and the last line of the code that run the "sleepingStages" function.


-------------------------


Observation: In my first approach to the problem I did it with list indexs, in consecuense the code was very unconfortable to read, improve and scale. That's why I change to more human nomenclature, avoiding list indexs.
